<h1>Livingstone The Tourist Capital of Zambia</h1>

<p>Livingstone is a town in southwestern Zambia, a few kilometers from the Zambezi River and the border with Zimbabwe. Itâ€™s a hub for visitors to the Victoria Falls. The adjoining Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park surrounds the Zambian side of the falls. The Livingstone Museum traces local history and archaeology, and the life of the Scottish explorer, David Livingstone, after whom the town was named.</p>
